	npm run test


Run single node test
---

	node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha -g regex test


Run subset of tests and analyze coverage
---

	node_modules/istanbul/lib/cli.js cover _mocha -- -g regex test


Debugging Tests Using Node Inspector
---

	$ node-inspector # leave this running in this window
	Use *Chrome* to visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5858

Running Browser Tests With Coverage
---

		$ npm run browser-coverage-full-test

You can filter full browser tests using the GREP env variable, e.g.

    $ GREP='e2e basic' npm run browser-test-phantomjs


Running Tests in Chrome and Firefox Automatically
---

Currently, this cannot be done in the VM as this project has not been configured to run Chrome and Firefox via Selenium headlessly. You can however use

    $ npm run test-firefox
    $ npm run test-chrome

to test outside the VM, assuming you have Firefox and Chrome installed.

Run tests in a browser
---

	$ npm run browser-server
	Use browser to visit http://127.0.0.1:8001/test/browser/index.html
